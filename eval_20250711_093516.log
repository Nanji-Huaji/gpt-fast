username_0: Go-ipfs has built-in support for running Bitcoin-based payments, which is needed for our payments system. We will switch to go-ipfs as the main package over the next few weeks.
<issue_comment>username_1: /cc @username_2
<issue_comment>username_2: I'm willing to help out with the switch.
<issue_comment>username_0: Go-ipfs is already the default package for go-wallet, so there won't be much need for it: https://github.com/bitcoin/go-bitcoin/blob/79d7e42c25b0f31ddbe530d0f4d0c1b7c43b69d2/wallet/wallet.go#L250-L255<issue_closed> <issue_start><issue_comment>Title: Add info to the home page about fees
username_0: So that people understand what they are paying for when they use our service, we need to add info to the home page about fees. There is a section called "My Payments" right now, but it only shows you when you make a payment, not per transaction. We need to add everything to that section. <issue_start><issue_comment>Title: Add a "Getting Started" section, particularly for new users
username_0: Currently, the Getting Started section is a bit rough and only covers the basics. We need to add more information to it, such as:
- How to create a new account
- How to send transactions
- How to track your transactions
- How to customize your wallet to work with different networks
- How to use the REST API

Perhaps we can also create a small document that can be included in the Getting Started section to provide some guidance to new users. <issue_start><issue_comment>Title: New release and update doc.

## Why this guide?

I wanted to create a guide that would not only teach you how to **write better code**, but also teach you how to **make money**. I've been a freelancer for a while now, and I've seen all-too-often people who don't know how to **write better code** and **make money**.

I know that there are a lot of great **web development courses** out there, with prices that can range from $100 to $1000 or more. But, there are a lot of **marketing courses** out there, with prices that can range from $100 to $1000 or more.

Both of those options are terrible value for money.

I want to show you how to **write better code** for free or at a fraction of the price of these courses.

username_0: Port vk_init() to C++ because:
- C++ is a better language for this purpose because of better syntax (we need to use `::` instead of `namespace` to access symbols).
- Boost.Scope can use C++, which allows easier translation to C++ code.

Hello, my name is David from [your_company].
We are working with a group of [number of customers] and we are interested in implementing a new pricing model for our service. We are looking for recommendations on what type of pricing we should consider for our customers.
We, as a company, understand that the best pricing strategy for our customers is to provide a fair and reasonable price for their services. However, we want to ensure that our customers understand what they are paying for and why, so we would like to have some guidance from you.
If you could please provide me with some clarification on the types of pricing models that you recommend, we would be very thankful.
We are ready to receive your guidance and recommendations. <issue_start><issue_comment>Title: Add a new note about using `db.model` instead of `Model`
username_0: Currently, `db.model` is used in a number of places to create models that can be used with an a-priori knowledge of the relationships between them, which can be useful for certain use cases. However, `Model` is deprecated and will be removed in a future release, so this might be a good time to clarify the use of `db.model` in such scenarios.

The RZ 450e is designed to offer both luxury and performance, while still providing a comfortable and efficient driving experience. Hereâ€™s a closer look at the all-electric Lexus RZ 450e:
Design and Exterior
The RZ 450e features a sleek, aerodynamic design that is typical of Lexus vehicles. The crossover SUV has a low and wide stance, which gives it a commanding presence on the road.

As the world undergoes a swift and profound transformation, sparked by advances in technology and a rapidly evolving global landscape, the role of education is also shifting. Education is not just about imparting knowledge; it is about preparing students for a future that is vastly different from the present.

In this new era, education must be more flexible and adaptable, able to keep pace with the rapid changes in technology and the world. It must also be more inclusive, providing equal opportunities for all students regardless of their background, and fostering a sense of global citizenship that prepares students to thrive in a diverse and interconnected world.

Furthermore, education must be more focused on developing critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities, as these will be essential for success in a world that is constantly changing. It must also be more focused on nurturing creativity and fostering resilience, as these are the skills that will enable students to navigate the challenges that they will face in the future.

Ultimately, education is not just about preparing students for the future, but also about empowering them to shape it. It is about equipping them with the knowledge, skills, and mindset that they need to make a positive impact on the world and to create a better future for all of us.

Hello, my name is Karen, and I am a 56-year-old woman who has been experiencing a wide range of physical and emotional symptoms over the past seven years. These symptoms include chronic fatigue, brain fog, joint and muscle pain, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. I have seen multiple doctors, undergone numerous tests, and tried various treatments, but none of them have been able to provide a clear diagnosis or effective treatment for my condition.

I have a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and I take medication for these conditions. My doctor recently recommended that I undergo a sleep study to see if my symptoms might be related to sleep apnea, but I am skeptical about this diagnosis and would like to get a second opinion. Is it possible that my symptoms could be related to adrenal dysfunction or another underlying condition? What tests or treatments might be recommended to help diagnose and address my symptoms?

Thank you for your time and any guidance you can provide. The Power of Mentoring and Coaching

Mentoring and coaching are powerful tools that can help individuals achieve their goals, improve their performance, and develop their skills. Both mentoring and coaching involve a relationship between two people, but they differ in their focus and approach.

Mentoring is a relationship in which an experienced person (the mentor) provides guidance, support, and advice to a less experienced person (the mentee). The mentor shares their knowledge, experience, and insights to help the mentee navigate their career or personal development journey. Mentoring is often long-term and focused on personal and professional growth.

Coaching, on the other hand, is a relationship in which a trained professional (the coach) helps an individual set and achieve specific goals. The coach uses a variety of techniques, including questioning, listening, and feedback, to help the individual identify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Coaching is often shorter-term and focused on specific skills or behaviors.

Both mentoring and coaching can be highly effective in helping individuals achieve their goals and develop their skills. However, the best approach depends on the individual's needs and goals. Mentoring may be more appropriate for individuals seeking long-term guidance and support, while coaching may be more appropriate

The internet can be a great tool for learning and staying connected, but it can also pose risks to children. Here are some tips for parents to help keep their children safe online:
1. Educate yourself and your child. Learn about the potential risks and dangers of the internet and talk to your child about them. Make sure your child understands that they should never give out personal information or communicate with strangers online.
2. Set rules and limits. Establish rules for internet use, including when and where your child can use the internet, and how long they can stay online.
3. Monitor your child's activity. Keep the computer in a common area of the house, where you can supervise your child's online activity. Check the browser history and ask your child about any websites they visit.
4. Use parental control software. There are many software programs available that can block inappropriate websites and monitor your child's online activity.
5. Encourage open communication. Talk to your child regularly about their online activities and make sure they feel comfortable coming to you with any concerns or problems they may have.
6. Teach your child how to spot online predators. Help your child learn how to recognize the signs of an online predator, such as someone who is too friendly or asks for personal information.
7. Keep personal information private. Teach your child not to share personal information online, such as their name, address, or phone number.
8. Use social media wisely. If your child uses social media, set up privacy settings and monitor their activity. Teach your child to be cautious about what they post and who they communicate with online. GABF 2022: The First Round of Winners
